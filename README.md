## Project Summary 📋
* Without any starter code, we are tasked with creating a personal portfolio from scratch to showcase our work using semantic HTML and advanced CSS techniques.
* The finished product can then be reworked and updated in the future by adding new applications and projects. It can also be reworked and improved as our skills and knowledge increase throughout the course.
