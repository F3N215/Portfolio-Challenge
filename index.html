        <h3>Refactoring Challenge</h3>
        <p>This project was a prime example of working with existing code to refactor and update an existing page to match accessibility criteria. Working with Horieson, a full-service digital marketing agency, I was tasked with assessing and updating code on Horieson's website assigned by my tech lead. By working to improve the HTML code without changing how it functions, and keeping the overall page within 90% of its likeness, I worked to ensure that Horieson's website adheres to accessibility criteria to ensure people with disabilities can still capably use the site.
